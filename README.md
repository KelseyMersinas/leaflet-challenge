# leaflet-challenge

Here I have used the Leaflet library to display earthquake data from the United States Geological Survey to create an interacive map. The USGS has a large amount of data that can be difficult to interperate without a visualization, but here the depth and magnitude of each earthquake is represented with the markers on the map with different colors and sizes.
